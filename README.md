# CSS Snippents for The Events Calendar Plugin By Modern Tribe
This is a repository of CSS Snippets for The Events Calendar by Modern Tribe. Each file has it's own snippet that will include a description of what it modifes and the CSS code to be added. 

Each file name begins with the view that the CSS snippet modifes. For example: the file *list-view-hide-event-image-and-description.css* modifies the **List View** by hiding the **Event Image and Description**.
